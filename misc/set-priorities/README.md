GOAL of this is to automate setting day by day goals for self.
To be used in conjunction with printing a template, that I can write before
going to sleep.


TODO's in Order as of 9/26:
0. Sort in order of priotiy [Done?]
==== PRIORITY ===
00. Check if file exists, if not, create it, / replace contents
5. Detect Environment (different computer/ user path, etc.) // config files to (initialize)
--> given a bootstrap.yml file, set configuration and update "writeAndFormat" - to pick up
--> otherwise...default

1. Randomizing order of "Congratulations", adverbs, and response statements (pull from internet)
2. Formatting output (low imp)
3. Have it enabled to take 0-3 goals at a time
4. Have it have syntax & syllable check! (and memorize internally for self)
